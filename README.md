# 💫 About Me:

🎓 I’m currently working on

  🧠 Building Machine Learning models for healthcare predictions such as Liver Detection and Anemia Disease, focusing on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to improve medical decision-making. My goal is to use AI to support doctors and enhance early disease detection.

  📊 Creating impactful Data Science & AI projects that showcase end-to-end workflows from data cleaning to deployment, helping me strengthen my portfolio and demonstrate real-world problem-solving skills.

  🌐 Developing full-stack web applications with ML integration to make intelligent solutions more accessible and interactive, allowing users to explore predictions in a user-friendly way.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on

  🏆 Open-source ML/DL projects where I can contribute code, models, or research and learn from other developers while solving practical challenges.

  🐍 Python-based automation & data cleaning projects that simplify repetitive tasks, improve data quality, and make workflows more efficient.

 🌟 Web applications using Streamlit / Flask to deploy ML models in a simple, interactive format that anyone can use without technical knowledge.

🙌 I’m looking for help with

   🚀 Deploying ML & DL models using tools like Streamlit, FastAPI, and Docker to create scalable, production-ready applications. I want to bridge the gap between model building and real-world usage.

  📚 Exploring advanced Deep Learning concepts such as Transformers and GANs to push my understanding beyond traditional models and work on cutting-edge AI applications.

  🛠 Learning MLOps best practices to manage ML pipelines, version control, and monitoring, ensuring models remain reliable and maintainable in production.

🏆 I’m currently learning

  🧠 Machine Learning & Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) to strengthen my foundation in both classical ML and modern neural network architectures.

  📊 Data Visualization tools like Seaborn, Matplotlib, and PowerBI to turn raw data into actionable insights with meaningful visual stories.

  ⚙️ Web frameworks such as Flask, Streamlit, and FastAPI, focusing on integrating ML models into interactive web apps that are easy to use and deploy.

💬 Ask me about

  🐍 Using Python, Pandas, and NumPy effectively in real-world projects, from handling missing data to building robust ML pipelines.

  🎯 How to start with Kaggle datasets, explore them, and build your first ML model step by step — even if you’re a beginner.

  🔰 Beginner-friendly tips to kickstart your journey in Data Science & AI, including resources, learning paths, and project ideas.

  🌐 Turning ML models into interactive web apps using Streamlit, making them more engaging and accessible for users.
